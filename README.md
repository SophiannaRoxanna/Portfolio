# 2023

One of my goals for this year is to code and commit at least one line of code everyday for the rest of the year.

I have decided that I would rather type with my fingers, than cross them and wait for manna to fall.

I figured the best way to start is by building a portfolio for me and any other person who is interested in using and editing it.

# PS: I am using a React Boilerplate worked on by my husband, I know right? How nice!

# Create React App Boilerplate

This project is the boilerplate for creating React Apps. Saving you the stress of adding them and setting up.
This boilerplate includes some dependencies for handling basic operations. You can (un)install them/more as you like.

## Add More

You can add as many dependencies as you want and build your project.
